          <h5 class="card-title">Kittens Found in Shed</h5>
          <p class="card-text">A kitten is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens display primary altriciality and are fully dependent on their mothers for survival. They normally do not open their eyes for seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens develop quickly and begin to explore the world outside their nest. After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow baby teeth. Domestic kittens are highly social animals and usually enjoy human companionship. The word "kitten" derives from the Middle English word kitoun, which in turn came from the Old French chitoun or cheton.[1] Juvenile big cats are called "cubs" rather than kittens; either term (but usually more commonly "kitten") may be used for the young of smaller wild felids, such as ocelots, caracals, and lynxes.[2] A feline litter usually consists of two to five kittens,[3] but litters with one to more than ten are known.[4] Kittens are typically born after a gestation lasting between 64 and 67 days, with an average length of 66 days.[3] When they are born, kittens emerge in a sac called the amnion, which is bitten off and eaten by the mother cat.</p>

          <p class="card-text">A dog park is a park for dogs to exercise and play off-leash in a controlled environment under the supervision of their owners. Dog parks have varying features, although they typically offer a 4-to-6-foot (1.2 to 1.8 m) fence, separate double-gated entry and exit points, adequate drainage, benches for humans, shade for hot days, parking close to the site, water, pooper-scooper to pick up and dispose of animal waste in covered trash cans, and regular maintenance and cleaning of the grounds. However, it is a norm to pick up after one's own dog. Dog parks may also offer wheel-chair access, a pond for swimming and a separate enclosure for small dogs. Some dog parks have separate play spaces for large and small dogs. Others have one large area for dogs of all sizes. There is debate about this issue, as some argue that dogs should be segregated by size,[1] while others feel that dogs of all sizes can and should socialize together.</p>
