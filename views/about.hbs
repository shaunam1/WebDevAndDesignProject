                Sligo Animal Rescue was set up by Anne White and her husband Jimmy in 2014. It started out as a small mission to improve the lives of animals in their community. Over time, as more and more animal lovers have joined the team, Sligo Animal Rescue has been able to save animals from all over the county (and sometimes, even beyond!). As a team, we have done everything from rehoming beloved pets whose owners have passed away to rescuing puppies from fires. We are always looking for more volunteers, vets, and pets who want to get involved.

          <p class="card-text">In 2024, we undertook our biggest mission to date. 57 horses were rescued from apalling conditions. These animals were abandoned on farmland and left to fend for themselves. Most of the horses were emaciated and walking on painful, overgrown hooves. The extraction took over 3 days, and was only made possible by the amazing volunteers and vets of Sligo Animal Rescue.</p>

            Since 2024, the rescued horses have flourished. All but 5 have been adopted and are getting the love and care they deserve. If you are interested in adopting any of these horses please get in touch.
